Bare Metal:

Is low level type programming that is hard-coded to a system at
the hardware level.

We jump past OS and DRIVERS and go to the direct hardware.

Sometimes we have the libraries like Arduino to facilitate programming.

In this case we want to just use the most basic level, in this case in C language.
